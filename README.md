# CPE_Corewar_2018

The Corewar is a game where champions written in redcode (an assembly-like language) are fighting each other in a Virtual Machine (the Arena).

This project consists in two binaries :

corewar
The asm compile redcode champions into binaries. The corewar takes binaries created by the asm and make them fight.
